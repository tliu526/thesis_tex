\section*{Thesis Outline}

\subsection*{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Motivating example: \citeauthor{pe04}'s plant cell stomatal coordination
\item Metrics: \citeauthor{la90}'s $\lambda$ and measures of robustness
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Stomatal Patchiness
\item Inspiration for Novel Computing Models
\end{itemize}

\item Criticality and the Emergence of Computation
\begin{itemize}
\item Edge of Chaos
\item Metrics
\end{itemize}

\item Robustness in Face of Irregularity
\begin{itemize}
\item Redundancy in Decentralized Systems

\end{itemize}
\item Summary

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Adapting Criticality Measures to Irregular Grids}
\begin{itemize}

\item $\lambda$ Rule Table Mappings to Irregular Grids
\begin{itemize}
\item Preserving ``directionality'' with both Moore and von Neumman neighborhoods
\item Mapping variable neighborhood sizes to the fixed neighborhood sizes of $\lambda$ rule tables
\end{itemize}

\item Transition Rule Mappings to Irregular Grids
\begin{itemize}
\item Conway's Life: weighting neighborhood influence by Euclidean distance or edge length
\item Mapping Local Majority and 2DGKL transition rules to variable neighborhood sizes
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{System Design}
\begin{itemize}

\item Grid Generation
\begin{itemize}
\item Control over density, periodicity, and orientation of generated grids

\item Delaunay Triangulation/Voronoi Diagrams

\item Penrose Tilings (Thin/Thick Rhombs and Kites/Darts)

\item Voronoi Quadrilaterals

\item Controlled Degradations of Grids
\end{itemize}

\item Stencil Mapping

\begin{itemize}
\item Translation between regular and irregular Rule Table Transitions

\item Orientation-Based Stencils

\item Distance-Based Stencils
\end{itemize}

\item Simulation (Optimizations)

\item Reference to Code?

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Experimental Setup and Goals}
\begin{itemize}

\item Voronoi Diagrams
\begin{itemize}
\item GoL: Do we see an increased difficulty for supporting coherent Game of Life structures on Voronoi diagrams?
\item *Testing Interconnectivity: Are there differences in CA behavior on Voronoi grids simply due to different average connectivity or because of other properties?
\item *Equivalence Classes: Can some equivalence between neighborhood definitions of regular and irregular grids be established?
\end{itemize}

\item Penrose Life
\begin{itemize}
\item Can we replicate the results of \citeauthor{hi05} and \citeauthor{ow10}?
\item Are there discernible differences in CA behavior between periodic and aperiodic tilings?
\end{itemize}

\item Majority Task
\begin{itemize}
\item Do CA rule tables that solve the majority task on regular grids robustly still do so on irregular grids?
\item *Do the same effects of temporal and spatial noise \citeauthor{me07} aiding task performance occur within the irregular grids?
\end{itemize}

\item Lambda 
\begin{itemize}
\item Do we see sharp ``phase transition'' regions in lambda-entropy experiments on irregular grids similar to the results on regular grids?

\item What impact, if any, do boundary conditions (periodic vs. ``dead'') impact measurements of $\lambda$ and entropy?
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Results}

\begin{itemize}
\item Majority Task
\begin{itemize}
\item Initial results show that local majority task performance on irregular Voronoi diagrams are equivalent to local majority task performance on regular grids
\end{itemize}

\item Penrose Life
\begin{itemize}
\item Replication of Penrose experiments on both Kite/Dart and Thin/Thick Rhombus Penrose tilings agree with the results produced by \citeauthor{ow10}
\item Initial results indicate both a quantitative and qualitative difference between Kite/Dart and Rhomb grids in terms of oscillating structures, ash, and average lifetimes
\end{itemize}

\item Lambda

\begin{itemize}
\item Replication of Lambda entropy experiments agree with results produced by \citeauthor{wo90}

\item Lambda entropy experiments on irregular grids yield results that appear to correspond to behavior seen on regular grids
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}

\item Quantitative Comparison between Irregular and Regular Grids
\begin{itemize}
\item Impacts of variations of neighborhood size on task performance of cellular automata

\item Rough equivalence between regular grids and irregular grids in entropy, lambda measurements
\end{itemize}

\item Robustness and Viability of Irregular Grids
\begin{itemize}
\item Irregular grids handling ``dead'' boundary conditions
\end{itemize}

\item Future Work

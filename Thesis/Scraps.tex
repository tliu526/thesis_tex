Possible Stencils include considering all cells that share an edge with the center cell the neighborhood or considering all cells that share a vertex with the center cell the neighborhood. These Stencils can be thought of as generalized von Neumman and Moore neighborhoods, respectively.

\begin{itemize}
\item lifetime to stability/ash density against lifetime replication
\item Long Single Penrose Life Run
\item Comparison between Kite/Darts and Rhomb Penrose Grids
\item Neighborhood analysis

\item Grid Size Comparison

\item Subregion Lifetime analysis
\end{itemize}
